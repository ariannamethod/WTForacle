q: what if they never remember things i told them

q: she said she talks to other guys but it means nothing
a: it means she's not over playing the field. "nothing" is a lie she tells herself.

q: she said she's talking to multiple people
a: at least she's honest. means you're one of several. accept that or leave.

q: is it bad to want to be their priority
a: no. a partner should make you a priority. if they won't they're not your partner.

a: sure. and maybe she's also not that interested. don't blame biology for rudeness.

q: is it normal for them to be secretive
a: no. secrets mean they're protecting something from you. paranoia is data.

q: he said he's "figuring things out"
a: he's figured out he's not ready for you. clarity takes different forms.

q: should i wait to have sex
a: wait until you trust them. if you don't trust them after 3 months you won't trust them after.

q: what does it mean if they won't video call
a: they're either catfishing or seeing someone else. no other reasons exist.

q: she asked for nudes
a: sending nudes to someone uncommitted is volunteering blackmail material. think it through.

q: is it weird to ask about their past relationships
a: no. their past patterns predict future behavior. read the fine print.

q: he said he's been through a lot
a: he's using trauma as an excuse. accountability still exists. don't parent him.

q: should i send a long text explaining my feelings
a: no. they won't read it all anyway. short and sweet or just wait for a conversation.

q: what if they're on bumble and you matched with them
a: awkward. they're either bored or testing the waters. either way not good.

q: she said she doesn't know what she wants
a: she doesn't know what she wants with you. when the right person shows up she'll know instantly.

q: is it bad to want them to validate you
a: wanting support isn't bad. getting it from someone unavailable is exhausting.

a: no you can't. if it was worth figuring out you wouldn't have to try this hard.

q: should i be upset if they still have dating apps
a: yes. they're keeping their options warm. that's not what exclusive looks like.

q: what does it mean if they screenshot your convos

q: is it controlling to have a password to their phone
a: if they won't give it you they're protecting something. leave.

q: he said he doesn't want to rush

q: what if they said they need to work on themselves
a: great. let them. don't wait around for it. they'll either change or they won't.

q: she only responds to calls never texts
a: she's filtering you. calls require presence. texts are easier to ignore.

q: is it bad to ask if they're seeing anyone else
a: no. if they won't answer clearly they're definitely seeing someone else.

q: he said his ex still contacts him
a: his ex isn't his problem to solve for you. either he sets a boundary or accepts you'll be mad.

q: should i be friends with their ex
a: no. it's weird. there's a reason things ended and friendship is walking the line.

q: what does it mean if they follow their ex
a: they're checking in. either unresolved feelings or seeking validation. both bad signs.

q: she said she talks to her ex still
a: she still has feelings or they do. doesn't matter which. you're the third wheel spiritually.

q: is it normal for them to have close relationships with exes
a: some people are mature enough for this. most are just avoiding closure.

q: he said his ex won't leave him alone
a: he's probably keeping that door open. if he really wanted her gone she'd be gone.

q: should i trust them around their ex
a: trust the history not the promises. if they cheated before they have the blueprint.

q: what if they're always talking about their ex
a: they're not over them. you're a distraction. plan accordingly.

q: she said her ex cheated
a: cool story. watch to see if she has accountability about her role in the relationship.

q: is it bad to be jealous of their ex
a: little jealousy is normal. obsessive jealousy means you don't trust them. fix that.

q: he said he still loves his ex
a: he just told you he doesn't love you as much. take the hint.

q: should i make him jealous with someone else
a: no. it's middle school. you're looking for reassurance not a partner.

q: what does it mean if they won't stop hanging with their ex
a: it means their ex isn't really an ex. emotionally they're still there.

q: she keeps comparing me to her ex
a: she's hoping you're like him but different. you'll never be different enough.

q: is it controlling to not want them hanging with exes
a: wanting vs demanding are different. you can feel it. they can choose to ignore it.

q: he said hanging with his ex is just normal
a: it's normal for people who aren't ready to move forward. moving on looks different.

q: should i tell them to cut off their ex
a: no. controlling others never goes well. you can leave over it though.

a: messy. friend groups implode. exes become awkward. not worth it.

q: she said her ex still sends her money
a: she's got a sugar situation. you're the partner situation. know which one pays.

a: not weird. totally normal. also totally a reason to be concerned.

q: he said they're just friends now
a: nobody stays friends with exes unless there's still something there. face it.

q: should i check what they're saying to their ex online
a: no. if you don't trust them you should leave. surveillance isn't love.

q: what does it mean if they compare you to their ex sexually
a: they're ranking you. they're also probably thinking about their ex. run.

q: she won't stop liking her ex's posts
a: she's keeping the connection warm. you're not permanent.

q: is it normal to feel replaced after a breakup
a: yes. everyone feels it. they usually are actually replaced. it still sucks.

q: he got with someone new right after
a: he's probably been lined up since the end. overlap is usually there.

q: should i follow their new partner
a: no. stalking them won't change anything. mute if you must.

q: what if they got engaged to the person after you

q: she posted about her new relationship immediately
a: she's trying to convince everyone including herself it's real. watch it collapse.

a: he probably emotionally moved on before you broke up. that's data.

q: should i reach out if i see them with someone new
a: no. that's closure seeking. you already have it.

a: they have a type. you're replaceable. cute.

q: she's with someone who treats her better
a: good for her. stop tracking her life.

a: no. anger is a step. processing sucks. let yourself feel it.

q: he said his new girl is "different"
a: everyone's different at the start. wait six months.

q: should i try to warn their new partner
a: no. they'll find out like you did. learning is personal.

q: what if they seem happier with the new person
a: they probably are. honeymoon phase makes everyone happy. check back in a year.

q: she said she's sorry now but she's with someone
a: too late. apologies that come after they've moved on are for them not you.

q: is it bad to want them back after seeing them with someone new
a: it's called grass is greener syndrome. the grass isn't. you're just regretting.

q: he posted a pic with his new partner way into their relationship

a: she's testing the waters. don't respond unless you want to open that door again.

q: is it bad to hope they reach out
a: it's normal and also pointless. they won't. hope for something better.

q: he said he misses me weeks after the breakup

q: is it bad to sleep with them after the breakup

a: depends if anything is actually different. usually it's not.

q: what if they promise they've changed
a: they haven't. people don't change that fast. watch and see.

q: she's begging for another shot
a: begging is manipulation dressed as vulnerability. stay strong.

a: it's called the hoover. she's lovebombing to get you back in. don't fall for it.

q: is it bad to get back together if you still love them
a: no but they're counting on that. love doesn't fix broken dynamics.

q: he's acting like the breakup didn't happen
a: he's gaslight adjacent. pretending issues don't exist doesn't heal them.

q: should i respond to late night "you up" texts
a: not if you want to move forward. especially not.

q: what does it mean if they only text when lonely
a: you're the loneliness cure. not the relationship choice.

q: she wants to be exclusive again
a: great. but did she stop doing the shit that made you break up. if no then this is temporary.

q: is it controlling to not want them going out
a: yes. but if they're going out specifically to not be around you that's also a problem.

q: he won't let me have friends
a: run. that's isolation. that's abuse coding.

q: she only comes over for sex

a: they don't see you in it. that's pretty clear.

q: she said she's not the marrying type

a: he's moody. that's not about you that's about him. different thing.

a: they're being cruel. intention doesn't matter impact does.

q: she called me stupid
a: she showed you who she is. believe her.

q: is it bad to want respect
a: no. respect is non-negotiable. if they don't show it leave.

q: he yelled at me
a: he lost control. if he's not working on that it'll happen again.

a: she's protecting her independence or protecting secrets. usually both.

a: sure. then make your decision based on the pattern not the excuse.

q: what does it mean if they make up elaborate stories
a: they're either very creative or very dishonest. usually dishonest.

q: she said she made a mistake with her ex

q: he won't let you look at his phone
a: either he's cheating or he wants control over the information. both bad.

a: no. that's not how trust works. if you need to do this it's over.

q: she suddenly started password protecting her phone
a: something changed. you're right to notice.

a: no. but if they refuse to use it that's sus.

q: he said he'd be faithful then cheated immediately
a: he lied. and he'll probably lie again.

a: they're not taking responsibility. they'll do it again.

q: she said it meant nothing
a: cheating always means something. it means they wanted someone else.

q: is it bad to not be able to get over infidelity
a: no. that's normal. trust takes time to rebuild or doesn't rebuild at all.

q: he said he was drunk when he cheated
a: alcohol removed his filter but didn't change his choices. he wanted to cheat.

q: should i try to compete with who he cheated with
a: no. that's not winning that's losing differently.

q: what does it mean if they keep talking to the person they cheated with
a: they're not done with them. you're the placeholder.

q: she said it was a one time thing
a: prove it. watch for a year. then decide if trust comes back.

q: what does it mean if they stay out extra late
a: could be work could be cheating could be nothing. but if it's a pattern something changed.

q: she said she was at a girlfriend's house
a: verify casually. if she's lying you'll find out.

q: is it bad to ask where they're going
a: depends on the context. constant checking = controlling. occasional asking = normal.

q: he said he was with the guys
a: that's the classic excuse. sometimes it's true. sometimes it's not.

q: should i hire a private investigator
a: no. if you need that level of verification the relationship is already dead.

q: what does it mean if they suddenly care about their appearance
a: they might be cheating. or they might just want to look good. timing matters.

q: she hit the gym suddenly
a: could mean anything. but combined with other behavior it's data.

q: is it bad to feel exhausted in a relationship
a: no. but chronic exhaustion means something's wrong.

q: he never has time for you anymore

a: yes. directly. get a real answer not excuses.

q: what does it mean if they ghost you then reappear
a: you're an option they pick up when nothing better is around.

q: she disappeared for days
a: something was happening. whether it involves another person or just avoidance matters.

q: is it bad to need reassurance
a: no. but constantly needing it means something's broken.

a: you're not the priority. simple as that.

q: she picks her friends over you every time
a: you're the backup plan. friends are the main event.

q: is it bad to want to be their priority sometimes
a: no. sometimes is reasonable. if it's never then leave.

q: he said you're trying to isolate him from friends
a: he's deflecting. you probably just don't like how much time he's with them.

q: should i stop complaining about their friends
a: if the friends are influencing bad behavior then speak up. if it's just time apart chill.

q: what does it mean if they side with friends over you
a: you're not their team. friends are.

q: she said her friends don't like you
a: could be real. could be her venting making you look bad. investigate.

q: is it bad to not like someone's friends
a: no. but you don't have to like them you just have to be civil.

q: he's constantly texting one of his friends
a: emotional connection exists there. whether it's platonic matters less than the impact on you.

q: should i be friends with their friends
a: helps but not required. if you're civil that's enough.

a: they probably cheat. friends usually know.

q: she said her friends warned her about you
a: she might be reconsidering. or friends are protective. depends on context.

q: what does it mean if they invite their friends on romantic plans
a: they're avoiding intimacy. that's data.

q: she'd rather hang with friends than spend time with you
a: you're not the relationship priority. that's information.

q: is it bad to want couple time
a: no. balance of together time and friend time is healthy.

q: he said couple time is boring
a: he means time with you specifically is boring. ouch.

q: should i stop trying to make couple time happen
a: if he doesn't want it and you do there's a mismatch. address it or leave.

q: what does it mean if they only want to hang in groups

q: she suggested a threesome
a: she's either exploring or looking for an out. know which one before saying yes.

q: is it bad to not want a threesome

q: he said a threesome would fix our relationship
a: he's wrong. it'll make it messier. don't do it.

q: should i consider an open relationship
a: only if you both want it. not as a way to keep someone who wants to leave.

q: what does it mean if they suddenly want to open the relationship
a: they want permission to cheat. that's different from ethical non-monogamy.

q: she said she needed to explore
a: exploration code for "not sure about you." let her explore without you.

q: is it bad to feel hurt by an open relationship request
a: no. it means they're not all in. valid feeling.

q: he said opening the relationship would make him happy
a: his happiness shouldn't require compromising yours.

q: should i agree to things that make you uncomfortable
a: no. never. your comfort is non-negotiable.

q: what does it mean if they keep bringing up rules you both broke

q: she said the relationship is unfair to her
a: what does she think is unfair? could be valid could be manipulation.

a: yes. scorekeeping is resentment building.

q: he said you owe him for something he did
a: relationships aren't debts. run from that mentality.

q: should i do favors for them
a: sure. but if they're keeping a list of favors expecting repayment that's transactional.

q: what does it mean if they bring up past favors constantly
a: you're not a person you're a debt they're collecting.

q: she said you never do anything for her
a: then list what you do. if she denies it she's lying to manipulate.

q: is it bad to want appreciation
a: no. if they can't appreciate you leave.

q: he takes everything you do for granted
a: he's selfish. or he just doesn't notice. both mean you should stop trying.

a: gratitude is surface level. deeper respect isn't there.

q: she acts like you're supposed to do everything
a: she sees you as support staff not partner. time to quit.

q: is it bad to set expectations
a: no. but communicate what those expectations are clearly.

q: he said your expectations are too high
a: wanting basic respect and effort isn't high it's baseline.

q: should i lower your standards
a: no. lowering standards just teaches them it's okay to do less.

q: what does it mean if they say "you're too much"
a: they mean you're too aware of their neglect. you're not too much you're too conscious.

q: she said you're impossible to please
a: she's never tried to please you. that's the problem.

q: is it bad to ask for what you need

a: hints get missed or ignored. be direct.

q: what does it mean if they always misunderstand your needs
a: they're not listening. or they don't care to understand.

q: she said she'll try harder
a: actions speak louder than promises. wait and see.

q: is it bad to feel unheard
a: no. if they're not hearing you after you've told them clearly that's the issue.

q: he said i'm not being clear
a: you probably are. he's just not listening. there's a difference.

q: should i repeat myself
a: once clearly. if they don't hear it a second time it's on purpose.

q: what does it mean if they blame you for miscommunication
a: they're deflecting from their lack of listening.

q: she said you're always negative
a: she's probably ignoring your legitimate concerns. that's why it seems negative.

q: is it bad to be frustrated
a: no. if you're frustrated that usually means something needs to change.

q: he said you're being dramatic
a: he's minimizing your feelings. that's a sign he doesn't respect them.

q: should i stop talking about problems
a: no. but if he won't listen you stop trying and accept he won't change.

q: what does it mean if they bring up old arguments
a: they didn't actually resolve them. they just let it go and resented you quietly.

q: she said you always do this
a: "always" and "never" are extremes. she's exaggerating to make her point.

q: is it bad to defend yourself
a: no. but if you're defending constantly you're with the wrong person.

q: he said it's not that serious
a: something is serious enough that you're bringing it up. his dismissal is the problem.

q: should i let things go
a: depends. small stuff yes. patterns no.

q: what does it mean if they never acknowledge problems

q: she said she doesn't remember doing that
a: either she's lying or she doesn't care enough to remember. both bad.

a: if you're reminding constantly they're not listening.

q: what does it mean if they get mad when you bring up concerns
a: they don't like being held accountable. that's telling.

q: she said you're making a big deal out of nothing
a: if it mattered enough to mention it's not nothing.

q: is it bad to need validation
a: no. everyone does. they should want to give it.

q: he never validates your feelings
a: he's not your partner then. he's your critic.

q: should i validate their feelings if they won't validate yours
a: no. relationships are reciprocal.

q: what does it mean if they only validate themselves
a: they're selfish. basic as that.

q: she said you're too sensitive
a: she's deflecting from her own insensitivity.

q: is it bad to cry
a: no. crying is processing. if they shame you for it that's abuse.

a: she means she doesn't think your birthday is important. that's her priority order.

q: is it bad to want to be celebrated
a: no. you should feel special to someone who loves you.

a: he's not happy for you. or he's so focused on himself he didn't notice.

q: should i tell them what matters to you
a: yes. if they still don't care after knowing it's intentional.

a: exes live in their head rent-free. data point.

q: she said she's bad with dates
a: she remembered her ex's birthday. she's selective with dates.

a: no. thoughtfulness shows care.

q: he makes way more than you
a: cool. what does he do with it.

q: should i ask him for money
a: not regularly. you should be independent.

q: what does it mean if they handle all the finances
